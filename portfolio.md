  This project is a custom web app designed to enhance studying for the IIAP certification exams, WAS and CPACC in particular. The app uses an integrated AI to generate questions that may appear on a certification exam. The AI adapts questions based on analysis of the user's strengths and weaknesses. The app tracks the number of correct vs incorrect answers and provides a topic breakdown to show the user's knowledge level. Additional features may be added over time; see the developer log for details.
