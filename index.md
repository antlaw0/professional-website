  <p>
    Accessibility is central to everything I do. As a lifelong screen reader
    user, I bring unique insight into the challenges people with
    disabilities face when interacting with digital products. I work closely
    with clients to ensure their software and services are usable, compliant
    with standards, and genuinely inclusive.
